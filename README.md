# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview

PyBer has tasked us to look over their ride share data to compare different city types. to come up wiht business decisions based on total weekly fares.

## Results

The main results of the summary are that: 
  - We can see that from best to worst in terms of weekly fares: we have Urban, Suburban, and Rural. 
  - Suburban is the fastest growing at the end of our analysis

  - Rural makes around one tenth that urban does, and suburban being around one third.

## Summary

The results lead us to make the following recommendations to PyBer:
  - Look into what happened in Feburary
    - All city types saw a dip in the begining of the month, then a relatively large growth, then a loss (for suburban areas it was a bigger loss than the growth). 
    - Investigating what was the cause of these dips should lead to more stable growth/loss patterns.

  - Continue with action in Suburban areas
    - As we can see at the end of the analysis Surban areas is experience a very high growth rate, so the tactics in marketing done for these regions should continue

  - Primary focus should be urban areas, while there is little to no need to focus on rural areas
    - Rural  on its best week made only a fourth of urbans worst week. It simply underperforms in fares compared to the other city types.
